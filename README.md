# Lab-01 / #Lab-04a

Objective for Lab-01:
Replicate the layout of the images show in the 'imgs' folder. When the browser window is full-screen, the 'desktop' img should be replicated. When it is sized down to a certain point it should replicate the 'mobile' img. This lab is designed to improve responsive web development skills.

Objective for Lab-04a:
Redo lab-01, but instead of using floats, use a **grid** layout.
